I am watching layout tutorials when i show this image then. I Think to make this fully colour changing abstract art with the help of layout and CardView. It is working well and I am happy to see this working well.
I am so, Happy seeing this app working and changing it's color. It was hard for me to make this project because I am beginner in android development.
